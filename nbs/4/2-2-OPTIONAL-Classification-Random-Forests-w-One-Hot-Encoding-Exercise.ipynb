    "-  education = the level of education of the individual (e.g., 5th-6th grade, high school graduate, PhD, so on)\n",
    "- maritalstatus = the marital status of the individual\n",
    "- occupation = the type of work the individual does (e.g., administrative/clerical work, farming/fishing, sales and so on)\n",
    "- relationship = relationship of individual to his/her household\n",
    "- race = the individual's race\n",
    "- sex = the individual's sex\n",
    "- capitalgain = the capital gains of the individual in 1994 (from selling an asset such as a stock or bond for more than the original purchase price)\n",
    "- capitalloss = the capital losses of the individual in 1994 (from selling an asset such as a stock or bond for less than the original purchase price)\n",
    "- hoursperweek = the number of hours the individual works per week\n",
    "- nativecountry = the native country of the individual\n",
