# Workshop: Python in Science and Research

Dive into the following topics

- Numeric Computation
- Data Visualization
    - basic plotting
- Text Analysis
- Social Network Analysis

## Front-Up Preparations

As this is a notebook class, you should try to set Python on your machine before we start with the actual workshop.

The easiest way to do so is by installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/).
Just download and install the current distribution with Python 3.6 or higher as described [in the Anaconda Installation Instructions](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).

Then test the Anaconda installation by running your first notebook:
Therefore run in a terminal:
```bash
$ jupyter-notebook
```
, open in your browser `nbs/0-a-Test of the Installation.ipynb` and run it ...

Further on in the workshop the following additional packages are required. We will install them together in the course, but if you want to play around upfront, please feel free to do so:
```bash
    conda install seaborn


    conda install -c scitools cartopy=0.15.0
    # or
    conda install -c conda-forge cartopy=0.15.1
    
    pip install graphviz
```
On OS-Level you also will need graphviz.
Please check the [Graphviz Homepage](http://www.graphviz.org/) about how to install on your Machine.

#### Refresher - Python(3) Basics
If you need a refresher of your Python knowledge the [Interactive Python Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) is a good starting point.

The Lectures 
- `Learn the Basics`: All and
- `Advanced Tutorials` 
    - Generators
    - List Comprehensions
    - Multiple Function Arguments
    - Sets
    - Partial functions

should be sufficient for attending the Workshop `IF PRO 02 Python f√ºr Wissenschaft und Forschung`.
